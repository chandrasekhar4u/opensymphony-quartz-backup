<h5><a name="BestPractices-JobDataMapTips"></a>JobDataMap Tips</h5>

<p>The <em>JobDataMap</em> that is found on the <em>JobExecutionContext</em> during <em>Job</em> execution serves as a convenience.  It is a merge of the <em>JobDataMap</em> found on the <em>JobDetail</em> and the one found on the <em>Trigger</em>, with the value in the latter overriding any same-named values in the former.</p>

<p>Storing <em>JobDataMap</em> values on a <em>Trigger</em> can be useful in the case where you have a <em>Job</em> that is stored in the scheduler for regular/repeated use by multiple Triggers, yet with each independent triggering, you want to supply the Job with different data inputs.  </p>

<p>In light of all of the above, we recommend as a best practice the following:  Code within the Job.execute(..) method should generally retrieve values from the <em>JobDataMap</em> on found on the <em>JobExecutionContext</em>, rather than directly from the one on the <em>JobDetail</em>.</p>

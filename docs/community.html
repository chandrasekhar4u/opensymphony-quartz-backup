<h3>User & Developer Community</h3>
<p>
	Quartz is an open-source project, and is always on the lookout for feature ideas, enhancements,
	bug reports and all-around help.  Find out how you can contribute (or get help) below.
</p>

<h3>User Forums</h3>
<p>
	If you can't figure something out, just ask in our helpful
	<a href="http://forums.opensymphony.com/forum.jspa?forumID=6&start=0">forum</a>. 
    Quartz contributors and seasoned users are known to hang out here frequently!
</p>
<p>
	Before posting a question, please double-check documentation
	(including JavaDOCs, the tutorial, and the docs in the distribution's "docs" directory).  When you
	do post in the forum, please note the version of Quartz that you are using, information about the
	environment in which you are using Quartz (app server version, database version, etc.), and any
	logged information about the problem (full stack traces, etc.).
</p>

<h3>Bug Reporting / Feature Requests / Patch Submissions</h3>
<p>
	Quartz uses the most excellent JIRA software to track issues. <br />
	<span class="primary micro">(We might be biased though... <a target="new" href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/">JIRA</a> uses Quartz as its scheduling component).</micro>
</p>
<p>
	Use JIRA to <a href="http://jira.opensymphony.com/secure/BrowseProject.jspa?id=10060&report=roadmap">report or submit</a> the following:
    <ul>
	  <li>Bugs - please be fairly certain the issue is, in fact, a bug.</li>
	  <li>Feature/Improvement requests</li>
	  <li>Code Contributions (patches or new features)</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h3>Paid (Commercial) Support</h3>
<p>
	Commercial-quality support and training for Quartz is also available through one of the following channels: <br/>
	<ul>
	  <li>From <a href="http://www.part.net/products.html#support">PartNET, Inc.</a> based on hourly rates or contracted arrangements.</li>
      <li>From <a href="mailto:jhouse@quartzscheduler.org">James House</a> (the primary developer of Quartz) based on negotiated pricing.</li>

	</ul>
</p>

<h3>Bug Reporting / Feature Requests / Patch Submissions</h3>
<p>
	Quartz uses the most excellent JIRA software to track issues. <br />
	<span class="primary micro">(We might be biased though... <a target="new" href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/">JIRA</a> uses Quartz as its scheduling component).</micro>
</p>
<p>
	Use JIRA to <a href="http://jira.opensymphony.com/secure/BrowseProject.jspa?id=10060&report=roadmap">report or submit</a> the following:
    <ul>
	  <li>Bugs - please be fairly certain the issue is, in fact, a bug.</li>
	  <li>Feature/Improvement requests</li>
	  <li>Code Contributions (patches or new features)</li>
	</ul>
</p>
